# DevOps + AI Notes
A repo to practice DevOps (K8s, Terraform, Vault, Ansible, Istio, Azure) and AI (LLMs, RAG).

## I organize exercises by levels:

- Basic – to get started

- Intermediate – to combine tools and workflows

- Advanced – real challenges mixing DevOps + AI

Each exercise includes clear steps, example files, and a place for my own notes and mistakes.

I'm learning cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure, automation, security, and how to use LLMs and RAG to improve real workflows.

## Tips:
- 30 min/day is enough

- Document every error

- Focus on consistency, not perfection

Need help? Just reach out. Teaching is the best way to learn.
